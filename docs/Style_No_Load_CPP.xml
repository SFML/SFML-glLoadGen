    <title>Style No Load C++</title>
    <para>The <literal>noload_cpp</literal> style works a lot like the near-defunct GLee loader. You
        don't need to call a function to load all of the function pointers; instead, you simply call
        the GL functions as normal. If it hasn't been loaded, it will be. This makes it among the
        most user-friendly of the loader styles.</para>
    <para>As a C++ style, it follows the naming conventions of the <literal
            xlink:href="Style_Pointer_CPP">pointer_cpp</literal> style. Everything is scoped into
        namespaces. The enumerators don't have the <literal>GL_</literal> prefix on them, and so
        forth.</para>
    <para>The system is designed to be automatic, responding to your application's needs. However,
        calling a function that the implementation does not provide will result in a crash, just as
        it would for the previous system.</para>
    <para>To help alleviate this, the system does have variables to tell you which extensions are
        available (at least, according to the extension strings). They are located in the
            <literal>exts</literal> namespace, using the <literal>var_&lt;extension name></literal>
        syntax, and they are C++ <literal>bool</literal> types. However, unlike the magic function
        pointers, you have to actually initialize them. You can call
            <literal>sys::CheckExtensions</literal> to initialize them. This function only
        initializes the extension variables, so it cannot report on the number of functions that
        failed to load.</para>
    <section>
        <title>Example</title>
        <para>This example is for loading the OpenGL functions; it expects the OpenGL header to be
            included. For loading WGL/GLX functions, include their headers and change the
                <quote>gl</quote> namespaces to <quote>wgl</quote> or <quote>glx</quote> as
            appropriate.</para>
        <programlisting>//Create OpenGL context and make it current.</programlisting>
        <para>That was a trick question: there is no initialization required. That is the whole
            point of this style, after all.</para>
        <para>However, if you want to query which extensions are around, you
                <emphasis>need</emphasis> to initialize that:</para>
        <programlisting>//Create OpenGL context and make it current.
gl::sys::CheckExtensions();</programlisting>
        <para>The presence of extensions can be checked as follows:</para>
        <programlisting>if(gl::exts::var_EXT_texture_compression_s3tc)
  gl::CompressedTexSubImage2D(gl::TEXTURE_2D, 0, 0, 0, 256, 256,
    gl::COMPRESSED_RGBA_S3TC_DXT5_EXT, compressedSize, compressedPixels);
else
{
  void *decompressedPixels = DecompressPixels(256, 256,
    compressedSize, compressedPixels);

  gl::TexSubImage2D(gl::TEXTURE_2D, 0, 0, 0, 256, 256,
    gl::RGBA, gl::UNSIGNED_BYTE, decompressedPixels);
  free(decompressedPixels);
}</programlisting>

        <title>Versions</title>
        <para>When you use this system and provide a version number of OpenGL,
                <literal>noload_cpp</literal> will assume that you are <emphasis>serious</emphasis>
            about that version number. Which means that if you create a 3.3 header, and you do not
            supply a context that claims support for at least OpenGL version 3.3, <emphasis>crashing
                may occur</emphasis>.</para>
        <para>In particular, OpenGL changed the mechanism to check for the presence/absence of
            extensions in version 3.0. Therefore, <literal>noload_cpp</literal> will also change how
            it checks for the presence/absence of extensions based on that. If you provide a version
            3.0 or greater, it will use the new style. Thus, if your context is only version 2.1,
            then this style will be unable to function and will likely crash when it fails to load
            an appropriate function pointer.</para>
